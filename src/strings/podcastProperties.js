    title:'Living The Gospel',
    description:'What does it mean to live the gospel? Our goal is to encourage and challenge each other and our listeners to the obedience of the faith. In other words, to be doers of the word, and not hearers only. Join Milenko, Eunice, Kathy, Julia and our guests weekly, as we explore the word of God and how we can live it in our every day, 21st century life.',
